"""
Define a bot command for simulating a coin flip with an animated embed message.

Parameters:
- bot: The Discord bot instance.

Usage:
- `./coinflip`: Initiates a coin flip simulation with an animated embed message.

Preconditions:
- The bot instance must be initialized and connected to the Discord server.
- The bot instance must have the coinflip command defined.
- The bot must have permissions to send messages and embeds in the channel.
- The bot must have permissions to edit its own messages in the channel.

Returns:
- An animated embed message that simulates a coin flip, ending with the final result (Heads or Tails).

Raises:
- No specific exceptions are caught or raised in this function. However, potential Discord API errors may occur if the bot lacks necessary permissions.

Note:
- The function uses asyncio to create delays, simulating the coin flipping process.
- The initial embed is blue, indicating the flip is in progress.
- The final embed is green, indicating the flip has completed.
- The flip animation shows 'Heads' and 'Tails' alternating 15 times before the final result.
- The final outcome is randomly chosen between 'Heads' and 'Tails'.
- The function demonstrates the use of Discord embeds and message editing for creating an interactive command response.
